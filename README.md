# RPS Challenge [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/TudorTacal/chitter-challenge.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/TudorTacal/chitter-challenge)

This project represents our forth weekend challenge at Makers Academy coding bootcamp.  

Chitter is a **web app** that allows the users to post a message or peep and see a list of all existing peeps. It has sign up, log in and log out functionality.

 It uses Sinatra for running a local server and Capybara for automated testing.

### Installation and Use

1. To run the program first run **bundle install**.
2. Run **ruby ./app/app.rb**.
3. In your browser, open the link **localhost:4567**.
4. Sign up with the required credentials.
5. Once signed up or logged in you can create a new peep or see list of existing peeps.
